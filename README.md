# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
A simple prediction system that classifies whether a patient's breast cancer is benign or malignant using machine learning, based on features such as radius, texture and concavity of the cancer cell nucleus. This system utilizes Logistic Regression for classification, and is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset in Kaggle. 
- Codes can be found in the Python script named '18_Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb'.
